# Freethought Forum - Hide Quoted Posts Extension

A browser extension designed for Freethought Forum by hiding quoted posts from ignored users and optionally replacing them with motivational quotes for more positivity and less negativity.

## Motivation

On the vBulletin-powered Freethought Forum, when users choose to ignore other members, they can still see the ignored users' messages when these are quoted by others. This extension aims to address this shortcoming by effectively hiding those quoted messages and offering an option to replace them with a motivational quote.

## Features

- **Hide Quoted Posts**: Efficiently hides any quoted posts from users you've decided to ignore.
- **Replace with Quote**: Optionally replaces the hidden posts with a motivational quote, providing a positive twist to your browsing experience.

## Installation

1. Download the extension from [PLACEHOLDER].
2. Follow the installation prompts.

## Usage

1. Once installed, navigate to Freethought Forum.
2. Ensure you've added users whose posts you do not wish to see in the extension.
3. Browse threads as you usually would. If a post quotes a user you've ignored, the quoted section will be automatically hidden or replaced with a motivational quote based on your settings.
